The East is Red

<p><strong>Not youth alone beholds the morning sun—ten thousand miles of land in crimson run.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A lovely traveler passed through a landscape unseen by others, bringing with her exotic warm breezes that swept across parched fields, rustled through treetops, and rippled the lake into shimmering waves.<br>
The fruit trees, enchanted by this beauty, hurriedly blossomed and bore fruit; birds in the forest scoured for the few remaining flowering branches, weaving them into a crown for her.<br>
Strolling through the falling petals, the traveler, unable to refuse such generosity, plucked a few crimson fruits; feeling shy about taking without giving, she emptied her pockets of all the flower seeds she carried, scattering them over every cracked patch of earth.<br>
Only the field remained barren, its heart filled with shyness and guilt—what could it possibly offer this delightful maiden?<br>
Summoning all its strength, it urged the seeds to grow swiftly, hoping she might witness the blossoms before she left.<br>
But the traveler was never meant to stay—the scenery was beautiful, the trees and birds most attentive, yet this was no place to call home.<br>
She departed, leaving behind wistful fruit trees, birds, and the field.<br>
The field’s flowers never reached her hands, though perhaps the next traveler would find a garden in full bloom.<br>
Yet none grieved,<br>
for spring had come.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Winter gave way to spring, autumn yielded to winter.<br>
Fruits became saplings, fledglings took their first flights; tree rings thickened, and summer rains polished wings to a gleam.<br>
In the garden the field had tenderly nurtured, the last chrysanthemum outlived its season, bare stems swaying in the cold wind.<br>
No longer desolate, the land had seen the traveler’s seeds sprout through the seasons, each flower blooming in its turn as promised—drinking dawn’s dew, basking in morning sun, dancing in the breeze, resting under moonlight.<br>
In spring, the field wove a crown of gardenias and hawthorn blossoms, white as the traveler’s dress.<br>
In summer, it fashioned a basket of crape myrtle and hibiscus, though the hibiscus wilted by dusk, much like her fleeting visit.<br>
In autumn, it dreamed of a bed sweet with osmanthus and aster, but the wind carried the fragrance away, indifferent to its longing.<br>
The flowers, embracing their purpose, reveled in their brief lives, preparing in the soil for journeys yet to come.<br>
The traveler never returned, unaware that her casually scattered seeds had grown into a garden, and the field never had its chance to offer its finest tribute.<br>
Winter gave way to spring, autumn yielded to winter.<br>
The field longed for snow, a warm blanket for the seeds below. Should the traveler ever revisit this hidden paradise, the garden would be worthy of her.<br>
In the drizzle of early winter, it drifted into sleep, dreaming of October’s last dandelions riding the wind, chasing the blush on her cheeks.<br>
“Aren’t you afraid the seeds won’t survive the cold?” asked the trees and birds, as the field lay bare once more.<br>
“It’s alright. I’ve seen spring.”<br>
For spring had come.</strong></p>

Preface
</h2><p>During the National Day holiday, I traveled through Shanxi with <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, visiting three cities in southern Shanxi—Jincheng, Linfen, and Yuncheng—and composed five poems to briefly document the journey.</p>

Southern Shanxi Journey · Part 1
</h2><p><strong>The door hides broken statues, the eaves bear golden chimes.<br>
Dabs of emerald dye the tangled woods, splashes of ink unfold jade skirts.<br>
Fresh branches climb rotten wood, the old lead the young.<br>
Lin Huiyin would weep—can a thousand years leave blank space?</strong></p>

Jade Emperor Temple, Fucheng Guan Yu Temple, Qinglian Temple, Jincheng</strong></p>
<p>At the Jade Emperor Temple, flash photography is banned in the Hall of Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the statues are hidden behind iron railings, their paint peeling, some even headless or limbless—a regrettable sight.<br>
The statues at Fucheng Guan Yu Temple are mostly modern recreations, crudely made and unappetizing. The architecture, however, is worth a look.<br>
Qinglian Temple sits high on a distant mountain, with breathtaking scenery along the way. In autumn, the mountains are lush, the waters clear, dotted with broad red and yellow leaves under a cloudless sky—a land of splendor.</p>

</h2><p><strong>Weary, the Green Emperor has yet to take his post, morning mist rushes to break the dawn’s chill.<br>
Just crossed seas of people to glimpse the Buddha’s face, now climb forested clouds to visit the temple.<br>
Nine golden bodies, nine lotuses, three gates, three altars.<br>
Before the scaled sunset gathers dusk, my light steed has leaped over layered peaks.</strong></p>

Kaihua Temple, Iron Buddha Temple, Dinglin Temple, Jincheng</strong></p>
<p>Early in the morning, I took the bus to Gaoping, first visiting Kaihua Temple before returning to Iron Buddha Temple. The latter, newly reopened, was packed, tucked deep in a small village courtyard. After queuing for over an hour, I glimpsed the Buddha’s face for just two minutes. Fortunately, I met a family of three in line—open-minded parents unbothered by anime and games. (Their twin-tailed daughter was adorable, by the way.)<br>
Dinglin Temple’s lotus caisson ceiling had also recently reopened, and I was lucky to see it—truly magnificent.</p>

Prelude to Water Melody
</h3><p><strong>The Buddha feasts on incense offerings, stone tablets drown in dust.<br>
I ask the hills beneath his seat: do sutras reach the divine?<br>
Shorn locks renounce desire, abstinence purges the halls,<br>
smiles mask wrath. They know the laws of five aggregates,<br>
yet fail to grasp the body of ignorance.<br>
False cymbals, temple repairs, deceiving the credulous.<br>
Promises of merit mimic the Tathagata’s great vehicle.<br>
Bribes buy devotion, virtue lacks faith—<br>
the Eight Precepts mislead the sangha.<br>
The chime-keeper chants wealth, the false Buddha saves worldly monks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lone Zither<br>

Little Western Heaven, Linfen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eight Precepts</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>No killing.</li>
<li>No stealing.</li>
<li>No sexual misconduct.</li>
<li>No lying.</li>
<li>No intoxication.</li>
<li>No adornments.</li>
<li>No high or broad beds.</li>
<li>No eating after noon.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Yellow Brow’s Counter</strong>:<br>
No killing? Hatred never ends.<br>
No stealing? Why distinguish strong from weak?<br>
No lust? All sentience is sin.<br>
No lies? Dreams, bubbles, shadows, void.<br>
No wine? Sorrow ebbs and flows.<br>
No pleasure? Beauty fades in a blink.<br>
No sloth? Suffering binds without release.<br>
No indulgence? All acts are joyless.</p>
<p>The lower temple of Little Western Heaven was unremarkable, filled with devotees praying for wealth and sons. A nun (?) sat nearby striking a chime, chanting promises of billions in daily earnings—utterly cynical.<br>
The upper temple’s Mahavira Hall boasts astonishing hanging sculptures, grand in scale. Sadly, the crowds left little time for close inspection. I arrived too late to receive Shanxi’s official commemorative postcard—a slight regret.</p>

</h2><p><strong>An ancient temple guards Pingyang, three quakes veil the Buddha’s light.<br>
The towering glazed pagoda, the ethereal Arhat Hall.<br>
Scriptures sought through merit, rain prayed for by kings.<br>
A canon passed to the East, the golden age of Tang began.</strong></p>

Guang Sheng Temple, Linfen</strong></p>
<p>Guang Sheng Temple in Hongtong County features a Rain God Temple in its lower complex, its walls covered in murals, though poorly preserved. The dim light inside made details hard to discern. Side rooms displayed official scanned reproductions—vivid and lifelike, truly masterful.<br>
The upper temple’s Flying Rainbow Pagoda is clad in glazed tiles, though only the first floor is open, with little to see inside.<br>
The rear courtyard’s Tianzhongtian Hall houses three colossal Buddhas, over ten feet tall, their elegant forms a marvel.</p>

Encountering Wei Taoran at Stork Tower
</h3><p><strong>No immortal of wine was I born,<br>
inking brows, grinding words.<br>
At Stork Tower, I duel Wang Zhihuan,<br>
below Taihang, I ponder the Chairman.<br>
You roam the world a free spirit,<br>
I’m trapped in the ivory tower, forever young.<br>
If heaven and earth offer no refuge,<br>
let poetry debts buy wine.</strong></p>

Yongle Palace, Guangren King Temple, Stork Tower, Guan Yu Temple, Yuncheng</strong></p>
<p>A rushed group tour in Yuncheng left little time for details. At Stork Tower, I spotted a stall boldly labeled &ldquo;Selling Original Poetry.&rdquo; After touring the new tower, I revisited the collection, struck by lingering awe. Wei Taoran, inspired by a Dali poetess, returned to literature—I too once wrote many poems, mostly idle scribbles, never considering it a livelihood.<br>
In high school, I gifted my poetry drafts to someone. After the breakup, I scarcely wrote again. First, gaming consumed me—I read little, my pen dry, my efforts unsatisfying. Second, life blurred like fog—neither piercing nor clear, I drifted in haze. Third, the ivory tower’s monotony left me numb, devoid of poetic spark.</p>

Afterword
</h2><p>The three cities of southern Shanxi each have their charm.<br>
Jincheng is bustling, with efficient buses and dedicated routes to attractions. Arriving downtown, the streets blaze with light.<br>
Linfen is peculiar—even areas around the bus station are dark, and distant sites lack dedicated transit, making private hires costly. Its public toilets are uniquely varied—I biked past twenty-plus on shared e-scooters, no two alike.<br>
Yuncheng thrives—shops and stalls pack main roads and alleys, with rumors of north-south markets (and delicious, honest-to-goodness buns).</p>

<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching—give your family a call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men have sorrow and joy, they meet or part again;<br>
The moon is bright or dim and she may wax or wane.<br>
There has been nothing perfect since the olden days.&rdquo;<br>

Though miles apart, we&rsquo;ll share the beauty she displays.</p></blockquote>

<p>But here, the sun was setting, now only revealing the tip of its crown above the distant mountains, like a dazzling gem embedded in the peaks. The child had already run far ahead, bathed together with the grassland in the golden hues of twilight.</p>
<p>The sun is about to set, and your child isn’t afraid?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. She knows the sun will rise again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

Preface
</h2><p>As the saying goes, <strong>the pinnacle of customization is the default</strong>.</p>
<p>While the default Windows setup can efficiently handle all tasks, it’s undeniably <em>ugly</em>.</p>
<p>With a performance-overkill PC at hand, it’s entirely justified to pursue some aesthetic refinements and simplifications to satisfy my <del>high-end taste</del> (lol).</p>
<p>Below, I’ll share the customization software/solutions I’m currently using or have tried.</p>
<h2 id="current-desktop-setup">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#current-desktop-setup"></a>
Current Desktop Setup
</h2><ul>
<li><strong>TranslucentTB</strong>: Transparent/acrylic taskbar effects</li>
<li><strong>Sapphire</strong>: Desktop icon interaction optimization</li>
<li><strong>Wallpaper Engine</strong>: To minimize GPU and memory usage, I’ve chosen a 4K video of Noa’s memory lobby from <em>Blue Archive</em> as the wallpaper. The entire Wallpaper Engine process consumes about 100 MB of RAM.</li>
<li><strong>Rainmeter</strong>: Only using an audio visualizer for aesthetics because Noa is already beautiful enough 😋.<br>
Previously tried hardware monitoring widgets but found them useless except for inducing anxiety—so I ditched them.</li>
<li><strong>QQ customization</strong>, <strong>NetEase Cloud Music customization</strong>, <strong>cursor customization</strong>, <strong>Obsidian themes and plugins</strong>, plus <strong>Edge browser’s iTab new tab page</strong> and various practical extensions. My current workflow is perfectly comfortable.</li>

QQ Customization
</h2><p>==Highly recommended!==<br>
QQ is something most Chinese people are forced to use yet despise—ads, pop-ups, unwanted entertainment pages, and a cluttered, dysfunctional interface.<br>
The Windows client improved somewhat with QQ 9, but the annoying elements are creeping back. Old habits die hard.<br>
To avoid enduring this daily torture, the great open-source-minded tinkerers of the Chinese internet have launched QQ overhaul projects. Today, I’ll introduce one such masterpiece: <strong>LiteLoaderQQNT</strong>.</p>
<p>LiteLoader is a plugin platform for QQNT. After installation, you can download numerous plugins.<br>
GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/LiteLoaderQQNT/LiteLoaderQQNT">LiteLoaderQQNT: QQNT Plugin Loader: Lightweight · Minimalist · Open-Source · Furry</a></p>
<p>Recommended plugins:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xinyihl/LiteLoaderQQNT-PluginInstaller/tree/main">PluginInstaller</a>: LiteLoaderQQNT plugin installer for easy updates and one-click install/restart. Install this first to simplify adding other plugins.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ltxhhz/LL-plugin-list-viewer/tree/main">LL-plugin-list-viewer</a>: Browse, install, and update LiteLoaderQQNT plugins. Lists most plugins with direct GitHub links. Installation is buggy—some plugins require manual setup, or QQ may fail to start. Best used as a plugin/theme viewer.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xiyuesaves/LiteLoaderQQNT-lite_tools/tree/v4">Lite Tools</a>: A multi-functional toolbox to avoid hunting for plugins. Key features:
<ul>
<li><strong>Chat interface美化</strong> (Telegram-style: avatars, timestamps, left-aligned messages)</li>
<li>Remove badges, VIP tags, and other clutter.</li>
<li>Right-click quick search for text/images, message-to-image conversion.</li>
<li>Highlight options and special messages.</li>
<li><strong>Mini-program links → URL cards</strong>, remember last position, quick &ldquo;+1&rdquo; (repeater).</li>
<li><strong>Message preview</strong>: Generates Telegram-like preview cards from the first link in a message.</li>
<li>Local emojis.</li>
<li>Message suffixes.</li>
<li><strong>Cache and highlight recalled messages</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Custom backgrounds</strong> with brightness, transparency, and blur effects.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify sidebar</strong> (all features toggleable).</li>
<li>Input box and message box toggles.</li>
<li>…and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xh321/LiteLoaderQQNT-QR-Decode/tree/master">QR Decode</a>: Decodes QR codes in QQNT chat images.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xh321/LiteLoaderQQNT-Directly-Jump/tree/master">Directly Jump</a>: Skips QQ’s link warning page.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MUKAPP/LiteLoaderQQNT-DeepL/tree/main">DeepL for QQNT</a>: Integrates DeepL translation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/d0j1a1701/LiteLoaderQQNT-Markdown/tree/v4">Markdown</a>: Adds Markdown support. Only renders for other QQNT users with this plugin, so mostly useless.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xh321/LiteLoaderQQNT-Kill-Update/tree/master">Kill-Update</a>: Blocks QQ update prompts (some plugins lag behind QQ updates).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mo-jinran/window-on-top/tree/v4">Window On Top</a>: Adds window pinning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Themes aren’t covered here—a decluttered QQNT is already decent-looking.<br>
There are also AI plugins (e.g., ChatGPT), but I’m too lazy to set up APIs (<del>no money</del>).</p>

<a class="header-anchor" href="#netease-cloud-music-customization"></a>
NetEase Cloud Music Customization
</h2><p>==Highly recommended!==<br>
China’s music platforms love bloat: communities, short videos, VIP spam.<br>
A music app needs just a few core features. While standalone players exist, they lack platform perks like song searches, comments, and collaborative listening. Sunk costs (playlists, artist follows, purchases) trap users in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Thankfully, NetEase Cloud Music has plugins. Here’s the loader: <strong>BetterNCM</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Official site: <a href="https://microblock.cc/betterncm">MicroBlock | BetterNCM</a></li>

<li>Community guide: <a href="https://v2e2npdz15.feishu.cn/docx/UZkSd9d46o4fVOxaPNBcGXSenme">Feishu Doc</a></li>
</ul>
<p>BetterNCM lets you download/update themes and plugins in-app—no GitHub scavenger hunts.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended themes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Materia You</strong>: Minimalist, solid-color backgrounds. Multiple color schemes.<br>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended plugins:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>RoundCornerNCM</strong>: Rounded corners (Windows 11 only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MikuPlugin</strong>: Toggles UI elements (e.g., hide videos/livestreams).<br>

          <p>A lovely traveler passed by a landscape that no one appreciated. She brought with her an exotic warm breeze that swept across the parched fields, brushed the treetops, and rippled the lake into a shimmering glow.</p>
<p>The fruit trees, utterly enchanted by this beauty, hurriedly blossomed and bore fruit; the birds in the forest scoured the land for the few remaining flowering branches, weaving them into a wreath to crown her head.</p>
<p>Strolling through the flurry of falling petals, the traveler, unable to refuse such generosity, plucked a few crimson fruits. Feeling guilty for taking without giving, she emptied her pockets of all the flower seeds she carried and scattered them across every cracked patch of earth.</p>
<p>Only the barren field felt shy and ashamed—what could it offer to this lovely maiden?</p>
<p>Summoning all its strength, the field urged the seeds to grow as fast as they could, hoping she might see the flowers in full bloom before she left.</p>
<p>But the traveler was never meant to stay long—the scenery here was truly beautiful, the trees and birds most attentive, yet this was not a place to call home.</p>
<p>When the traveler departed, the fruit trees, the birds, and the field all felt a pang of longing.</p>
<p>The field’s flowers never reached her hands, but perhaps the next traveler would see a splendid garden in their place.</p>
<p><strong>Yet no one grieved over this,</strong></p>
<p><strong>for spring had once visited.</strong></p>
