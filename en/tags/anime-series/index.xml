          <p>After watching too many thesis defenses, I went back for a second viewing of <em>The Legend of Zhang Beihai</em> to cleanse my eyes.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend starting the animation of sci-fi novels with <em>The Three-Body Problem</em>—the IP is too massive to handle. Right now, the domestic sci-fi scene seems fixated on milking Liu Cixin dry. In my opinion, the domestic film and TV industry, with its mature experience in romance productions, could start with authors like He Xi instead.<br>
Top-tier funding, an ultra-long production period, and yet they delivered <em>this</em>—what a brutal blow to China’s sci-fi industry.<br>
The team behind <em>My Three-Body</em> practically wore out their copies of <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> while making it, just like how the crew of the 87 <em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em> adaptation had all read the novel, even bringing in Redology scholars as consultants. I wonder how many people at Yixu Kaitian have actually read <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> cover to cover, even once?<br>
Give sci-fi the means to thrive commercially, not the other way around. It’s hard to say whether the influx of capital has been a net positive or negative for the industry’s development.<br>
Chinese sci-fi still has a long, arduous road ahead.</p>
<p>Farewell, the sunrise I once gazed upon, the guiding light now a dying ember on a stranger’s path.</p>
<p>Heh heh, Dongfang Yanxu, my Dongfang Yanxu, heh heh (even getting excited over blocky characters—impressive, huh? That’s me for you.)</p>
