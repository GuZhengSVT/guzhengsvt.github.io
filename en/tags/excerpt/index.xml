<![CDATA[<h1>Leaning on railings, I hear the rain rushing; For my homeland my heart is aching.</h1><p>Author: 孤筝(lvbowen040427@163.com)</p>
        
          <p>&ldquo;I have a dream that one day, the brilliant sunlight will pierce through the dark forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here, the sun was setting, now only revealing the tip of its crown above the distant mountains, like a dazzling gem embedded in the peaks. The child had already run far ahead, bathed together with the grassland in the golden hues of twilight.</p>
<p>The sun is about to set, and your child isn’t afraid?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. She knows the sun will rise again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good night.<br>

<![CDATA[<h1>Selected Short Poems</h1><p>Author: 孤筝(lvbowen040427@163.com)</p>
        
          <p>You stand on the bridge to gaze at the view,<br>
While someone watches you from a tower.<br>
The bright moon adorns your window,<br>
And you adorn another’s dream.</p>
<p>— <em>Fragment</em> by Bian Zhilin</p>
<p>How I wish for a doorway,<br>
Where morning sunlight falls on the grass.<br>
We stand there, leaning against the door,<br>
Low as it is, the sun shines bright.<br>
The grass sows its seeds, the wind shakes the leaves,<br>
We stand, silent, and it is enough.</p>
<p>— Gu Cheng, <em>A Generation</em>, <em>Avoidance</em>, <em>Before the Door</em></p>
<p>Spring sorrow waits for wine to drown,<br>
Boats rock on the river, curtains beckon from towers.<br>
Time slips away too soon—<br>
Cherries redden, bananas green.</p>
<p>— <em>A Twig of Mume Blossoms</em> by Jiang Jie</p>
<p>From now on, I care not for fine nights,<br>
Let the bright moon sink west without me.</p>
<p>— <em>Writing Emotion</em> by Li Yi</p>
<p>The hills have trees, and trees have branches,<br>
My heart adores you, but you do not know.</p>
<p>— <em>Song of the Yue Boatman</em>, Anonymous</p>
<p>The carved die inlaid with red beans—<br>
Deep in my bones, do you know this longing?</p>
<p>— <em>New Lyrics to Willow Branches</em> by Wen Tingyun</p>
<p>A crane’s shadow crosses the cold pond,<br>
The frigid moon buries the flower’s soul.</p>
<p>— <em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em></p>
<p>Though knowing this love brings no good,<br>
I can’t help but ache with tender madness.</p>
<p>— Li Shangyin</p>
<p>What the world holds least firm—<br>
Youth fades like flowers from the mirror, from the tree.</p>
<p>— <em>Butterfly in Love with Flowers</em> by Wang Guowei</p>
<p>Not a flower, not a mist,<br>
Coming at midnight, gone by dawn,<br>
Like a spring dream—how long does it stay?<br>
Like morning clouds—where does it drift?</p>
<p>— <em>Not a Flower</em> by Bai Juyi</p>
<p>Helpless before morning’s chill rain, evening’s wind—<br>
Life’s long regrets flow east like endless rivers.</p>
<p>— Li Yu’s poetry</p>
<p>Drunk, I forget the sky mirrors the water,<br>
A boatful of clear dreams presses down the Milky Way.</p>
<p>— <em>Inscription on Longyang’s Green Grass Lake</em> by Tang Wenru</p>
<p>Free petals drift light as dreams,<br>
Endless drizzle fine as sorrow.</p>
<p>— <em>Silk-Washing Stream</em> by Qin Guan</p>
<p>In youth, I listened to rain in song-filled towers,<br>
Red candles dim behind silk curtains.<br>
In middle age, I listened to rain on a traveler’s boat,<br>
Wide river, low clouds, lone goose crying in west wind.<br>
Now I listen to rain beneath a temple’s eaves,<br>
My hair already streaked with stars.<br>
Joys and sorrows, partings and reunions—all unfeeling.<br>
Let the raindrops on the steps fall till dawn.</p>
<p>— <em>Listening to the Rain</em> by Jiang Jie</p>
<p>The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky,<br>
River maples, fishing fires—sleeping in sorrow.</p>
<p>— <em>Mooring by Maple Bridge at Night</em> by Zhang Ji</p>
<p>That gentlest bow of your head,<br>
Like a lotus flower shy of the cool breeze.</p>
<p>— <em>By Chance</em>, <em>Sayonara</em> by Xu Zhimo</p>
<p>If there is an afterlife, I’d be a tree,<br>
Standing eternal, without joy or sorrow.<br>
Half rooted in earth, serene,<br>
Half dancing in the wind;<br>
Half offering shade,<br>
Half basking in sunlight.<br>
Silent, proud,<br>
Never leaning, never seeking.</p>
<p>— <em>If There Is an Afterlife</em> by Sanmao</p>
<p>So I open the yellowed title page,<br>
Fate bound it clumsily.<br>
Tearfully, I read it again and again,<br>
Yet must admit—<br>
Youth is a book too hastily written.</p>
<p>— <em>Youth</em> by Xi Murong</p>
<p>Let life be beautiful like summer flowers,<br>
And death like autumn leaves.</p>
<p>The world has kissed my soul with its pain,<br>
Asking for its return in songs.</p>
<p>Only through the grind of hell<br>
Can one forge the power to create heaven;<br>
Only fingers bleeding from the strings<br>
Can play the world’s most haunting music.</p>
<p>When you weep for missing the sun,<br>
You also miss the stars.</p>
<p>The sky leaves no trace of wings,<br>
But I have flown.</p>
<p>My eyes rain for her,<br>
But my heart holds an umbrella—<br>
This is love.</p>
<p>— <em>Stray Birds</em>, <em>Gitanjali</em> by Rabindranath Tagore</p>
<p>White sun, scattered clouds—startled apart,<br>
Beneath the flowers, no one speaks of idleness.</p>
<p>— <em>Floating Life</em> by Gu Zhe</p>
<p>Ten miles of flat lake, frost-filled sky,<br>
Each inch of dark hair grieves fleeting youth.<br>
Gazing alone at the moon, longing for care,<br>
I envy not immortals, but lovebirds paired.</p>
<p>— From the film <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em></p>
<p>Morning breezes will still brush my face,<br>
Cuckoos will still sing on branches,<br>
Earth will still breathe its fragrance,<br>
Red maples will still flutter and fade.<br>
I choose to believe, as ever,<br>
That amid life’s cold ashes,<br>
Remembering all about you<br>
Was always my lifelong sorrow.</p>
<p>— Zhang Hansi, <em>Abnormal Human Syndromes</em> (Léont Blanc)</p>
<p>Octopus pot—<br>
A fleeting dream<br>
Under the summer moon.</p>
<p>— Matsuo Bashō</p>
<p>Flower shadows sway—<br>
I long to tread them,<br>
Moonlit crags ahead.</p>
<p>— Hara Sekitei</p>
<p>Grass in haze,<br>
Water soundless—<br>
Dusk falls.</p>
<p>— Yosa Buson</p>
<p>A lone horse, dust-stained,<br>
A thousand peaks at dawn and dusk.<br>
Gazing far where the sunset fades,<br>
I linger toward distant hills.<br>
Old post-station flowers by the road,<br>
A wild village, bamboo fences aglow.<br>
Who pities my backward glance,<br>
Step by step, longing for southern boughs?</p>
<p>— <em>Staying Late at Bamboo Lodge, Remembering Past Travels in Ganyue</em> by Liu Changqing (Tang Dynasty)</p>

<![CDATA[<h1>Selected Poems from *Dream of the Red Chamber*</h1><p>Author: 孤筝(lvbowen040427@163.com)</p>
        
          <p><strong>Prelude</strong></p>
<p>In realms primordial who played the lover?<br>
None but the breeze and moon enchanted me.<br>
So now I seize these days of dark spring weather<br>
To ease my heart by writing this poor story.<br>
Hence this <em>Dream of Golden Days</em>,<br>
This lament for my golden girls.</p>
<p><strong>[Life&rsquo;s Mistakes]</strong></p>
<p>They keep saying this golden match is blest,<br>
Yet I recall the pledge between plant and stone.<br>
Vainly I face this snow of classic purity,<br>
Still can&rsquo;t forget that fairy wood forlorn.<br>
Now I know the fairest bloom is the most fragile,<br>
And trust no more the love that&rsquo;s pledged in vain.<br>
Though we seem paired as phoenixes in life,<br>
My heart to the end remains unfulfilled.<br>
<em>(Daiyu, Baochai)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Vain Longing]</strong></p>
<p>One is a flower from paradise,<br>
One a pure jade without spot or stain.<br>
If one is not fated to be his bride,<br>
Why did she meet him again in this life?<br>
If one is fated to be his bride,<br>
Why does her love come to nothing in the end?<br>
One sighs to no purpose,<br>
The other yearns in vain;<br>
One is the moon reflected in the water,<br>
The other but a flower in the mirror.<br>
How many tears can well from her eyes?<br>
Can they flow on from autumn till winter,<br>
From spring till summer?<br>
<em>(Daiyu, Baoyu)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Death&rsquo;s Uncertainty]</strong></p>
<p>In the full bloom of fortune,<br>
Death comes unexpected.<br>
With staring eyes,<br>
She abandons all worldly affairs.<br>
Drifting, drifting,<br>
Her fragrant soul is spent.<br>
Gazing toward home,<br>
Mountains and rivers bar the way.<br>
In dreams she tells her parents:<br>
&ldquo;Your child has gone to the Yellow Spring.<br>
O kinsmen,<br>
Retreat before it is too late!&rdquo;<br>
<em>(Yuanchun)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Separation of Flesh and Bone]</strong></p>
<p>Three thousand li the wind and waves have blown<br>
Me far from home and all my kin.<br>
Lest grief should wear my parents out,<br>
I beg them not to mourn for me.<br>
Since poverty and riches are decreed,<br>
Partings and reunions are fated too.<br>
Though from today we dwell apart,<br>
Be comforted and live at peace.<br>
I must go now —<br>
Do not grieve for me!<br>
<em>(Tanchun)</em></p>
<p><strong>[False Love]</strong></p>
<p>A wolf in the hills, a savage beast,<br>
He thinks nothing of past obligations.<br>
Proud, lewd and cruel, he schemes for his base lusts.<br>
He looks on a gentle beauty as a willow,<br>
Tramples a noble family&rsquo;s daughter in the mud.<br>
Alas, her sweet soul in a year has fled.<br>
<em>(Yingchun)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Hard to Escape the World]</strong></p>
<p>Her beauty is rare as an orchid,<br>
Her talents supreme as an immortal.<br>
Heaven made her eccentric,<br>
Too proud to take meat as food,<br>
Disdaining silk and satin.<br>
But the higher the rank, the greater the envy;<br>
The purer her chastity, the sharper the spite.<br>
Alas, in dim-lit halls she will grow old,<br>
Missing the splendour of crimson towers,<br>
Till she falls at last into the mire.<br>
Pure white jade sunk in the filth —<br>
No need for lords to sigh at her fate.<br>
<em>(Miaoyu)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Grief in the Midst of Joy]</strong></p>
<p>While still in swaddling clothes<br>
She lost her parents,<br>
And though born to silken luxury<br>
No one spoiled her.<br>
Happy her nature, open-hearted and generous,<br>
Never a slave to love&rsquo;s foolish passion,<br>
She shone like moonlight on jade halls.<br>
She was wed to a talented, handsome husband,<br>
Hoping for long life together<br>
To make up for her wretched childhood.<br>
Yet soon the clouds scatter over Chu Gorge,<br>
The river dries up in the land of streams.<br>
This is the common fate of mortals —<br>
Why vainly grieve?<br>
<em>(Xiangyun)</em></p>
<p><strong>[The Vanity of Spring]</strong></p>
<p>She sees through the three springs,<br>
What use are peach and plum?<br>
She quenches the fire of youth<br>
To seek pure calm.<br>
What though the heavenly peach blooms fair,<br>
The clouds are thick with almond flowers?<br>
In the end, who can escape autumn?<br>
See there,<br>
In the village of white poplars<br>
People weep,<br>
And ghosts chant under green maples.<br>
Grave mounds are lost in rank weeds.<br>
The rich of yesterday are poor today,<br>
Spring&rsquo;s flowers wither in fall.<br>
Who can escape the doom of birth and death?<br>
They say<br>
In the Western Paradise<br>
The sacred trees bear fruit of immortality.<br>
<em>(Xichun)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Too Much Cunning]</strong></p>
<p>Too much cunning in plotting and scheming,<br>
Too much cunning brings your life to nothing.<br>
Your heart is broken in life,<br>
Your ghost in death must wander.<br>
A rich house, a peaceful home —<br>
In the end all is scattered.<br>
Vain your anxious planning for half a lifetime,<br>
Like a fitful dream at dead of night.<br>
Suddenly the great mansion totters,<br>
The lamp flickers in the wind.<br>
Ah! Joy turns to sorrow,<br>
Human life is hard to predict.<br>
<em>(Xifeng)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Leftover Blessings]</strong></p>
<p>Leftover blessings, leftover blessings,<br>
Unexpectedly she meets a saviour.<br>
Lucky her mother, lucky her mother,<br>
Who stored up virtue.<br>
Exhort all men to succour the poor and needy,<br>
Not like that heartless uncle and cousin who loved silver<br>
And forgot their own flesh and blood!<br>
For fate has its reckonings,<br>
And Heaven its way.<br>
<em>(Qiaojie)</em></p>
<p><strong>[The End of Good Fortune]</strong></p>
<p>Fragrant dust falls when painted beams crumble.<br>
Seductive charms and beauty<br>
Brought the house to ruin.<br>
The fault began with Jing,<br>
The guilt lies first with Ning —<br>
But all sins spring from lust.<br>
<em>(Qin Keqing)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Late Glory]</strong></p>
<p>Love in the mirror gone,<br>
How can fame in dreams endure?<br>
Her glorious youth sped fast!<br>
No more the nuptial bed.<br>
Her pearl crown and phoenix cape<br>
Cannot avert the doom of death.<br>
Proudly she wears her hairpin of office,<br>
Proudly she wears her hairpin of office;<br>
Brightly her golden badge of honour,<br>
Splendid her noble rank,<br>
Splendid her noble rank —<br>
But dark the road to the Yellow Spring.<br>
Ask of ancient generals and ministers —<br>
Are any left?<br>
Only an empty name for men to praise.<br>
<em>(Li Wan)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Epilogue: Each Bird Flies Back to Its Wood]</strong></p>
<p>The office-holder&rsquo;s wealth is all spent. <em>(Xiangyun)</em><br>
The rich man&rsquo;s family is completely ruined. <em>(Baochai)</em><br>
The kind escape with their lives. <em>(Qiaojie)</em><br>
The cruel meet with retribution. <em>(Miaoyu)</em><br>
Those who took a life have paid with their own. <em>(Yingchun)</em><br>
The tears one owed have all been shed. <em>(Daiyu)</em><br>
Not light the retribution for sins. <em>(Qin Keqing)</em><br>
Partings and reunions are predestined. <em>(Tanchun)</em><br>
To know your fate, ask about your past life. <em>(Yuanchun)</em><br>
Luck comes with old age. <em>(Li Wan)</em><br>
The disillusioned escape from the world. <em>(Xichun)</em><br>
The infatuated throw away their lives. <em>(Xifeng)</em><br>
Like birds who, having eaten, fly back to the wood,<br>
Leaving the landscape white and desolate.</p>
<p><strong>Author&rsquo;s Origin</strong></p>
<p>At the point of saddest passion,<br>
The absurd seems most pitiful.<br>
All men share the same dream,<br>
Laugh not at the world&rsquo;s folly!</p>
<p><strong>Author&rsquo;s Inscription</strong></p>
<p>Pages full of idle words,<br>
Penned with hot and bitter tears.<br>
All men call the author mad,<br>
None his secret message hears.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary on the &ldquo;Song of Good Fortune&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Mean huts and empty halls<br>
Where once were beds of state;<br>
Dry grass and withered weeds<br>
Where once were flowers in bloom.<br>
Cobwebs hang from carved rafters,<br>
While gauze now covers the window.<br>
What though rouge and powder were fresh,<br>
Now white locks hang at the temples?<br>
Yesterday yellow earth received white bones,<br>
Today red lanterns light the love-birds&rsquo; nest.<br>
Gold fills the chests, silver the boxes,<br>
But soon all turn to beggars, scoffed at by all.<br>
While mourning others&rsquo; untimely death,<br>
You may die yourself unawares.<br>
Though you give your son good training,<br>
He may turn out a brigand.<br>
Choosing a fine husband for your daughter,<br>
She may end as a singsong girl.<br>
Too low a rank invites disgrace,<br>
Too much wealth may bring ruin.<br>
Yesterday in rags you shivered with cold,<br>
Today in purple robes you fret at the confinement.<br>
All is confusion as one act ends, another starts;<br>
Mistaking the transient for the eternal,<br>
How absurd in the end<br>
To slave for others!</p>
<p><strong>Linjiangxian - Baochai</strong></p>
<p>Before white marble halls<br>
Spring dances in the breeze,<br>
Evenly wafted by the east wind.<br>
Bees and butterflies flit in swarms —<br>
Why drift away with the stream?<br>
Why sink in the dust?<br>
Thousands of strands remain unchanged,<br>
Let them join or part as they will.<br>
Laugh not at these flowers rootless,<br>
But borrow their power to soar on high!</p>
<p><strong>Xijiangyue - Baoqin</strong></p>
<p>The Han garden&rsquo;s blooms are few,<br>
The Sui Dyke&rsquo;s willows endless.<br>
Spring&rsquo;s work is left to the east wind,<br>
Moonlight and mume-blossoms a dream.<br>
In how many courtyards petals lie scattered?<br>
Whose gauze curtains breathe fragrance?<br>
North and south of the river it is the same —<br>
Only the parting grieves.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-Autumn Festival Couplets</strong></p>
<p>On mid-autumn&rsquo;s festive night<br>
We roam as at the Feast of Lanterns.<br>
The sky is strewn with stars,<br>
The earth with music loud.<br>
In many homes goblets fly,<br>
No doors are closed.<br>
The light wind blows chilly,<br>
The fine night is merry.<br>
Old men mock at cake-fighters,<br>
Young girls laugh at melon-carvers.<br>
Fragrant cassia blooms,<br>
Golden day-lilies flourish.<br>
Candles light the feast,<br>
Wine-cups crowd the garden.<br>
Teams are formed for forfeits,<br>
Guessing games played.<br>
Dice throw crimson spots,<br>
Drums pass flowers fast.<br>
Clear light fills the courtyard,<br>
Silver bathes the world.<br>
No guests outrank hosts,<br>
Poems are judged by all.<br>
Some muse by the balustrade,<br>
Some watch from the door.<br>
Though wine is finished,<br>
The fun is not over.<br>
As talk and laughter fade,<br>
Frost leaves its traces.<br>
Dew beads morning mushrooms,<br>
Mist veils evening trees.<br>
Swift autumn streams gush,<br>
Wind-blown leaves gather.<br>
The Weaving Maid shines pure,<br>
The Silver Toad breathes deep.<br>
The hare in the moon pounds herbs,<br>
Men race to the Palace of the Moon.<br>
They pass the stars in the Dipper,<br>
Ride a raft to the Celestial River.<br>
The full moon may wane,<br>
The bright orb may dim.<br>
The water-clock drips dry,<br>
The lamp by the window gutters.<br>
A stork&rsquo;s shadow crosses cold pool,<br>
Cold moon buries flowers&rsquo; souls.<br>
Incense from the golden tripod spent,<br>
Ice chills the jade bowl.<br>
The flute makes the widow weep,<br>
The quilt warms the maid.<br>
The phoenix curtain hangs idle,<br>
The peacock screen folded.<br>
Dew thick, moss grows slippery,<br>
Frost heavy, bamboos hard to grasp.<br>
Still we skirt winding pools,<br>
Climb the silent hill.<br>
Strange rocks crouch like monsters,<br>
Gnarled trees crouch like tigers.<br>
The tortoise glows in morning light,<br>
The screen glistens with dew.<br>
Birds in thousands of trees call,<br>
Apes in the valley shriek.<br>
Familiar with the path, we forget its turns,<br>
Knowing the source, we need not ask.<br>
Bells chime from Green Lattice Nunnery,<br>
Cocks crow in Paddy-Sweet Cottage.<br>
Joy may lead to sorrow,<br>
Freedom from care to vexation.<br>
Sweet fancies must be indulged alone,<br>
To whom tell our refined delight?<br>
All night we talk,<br>
Brew tea and analyze.</p>
